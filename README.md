# Recipe App

- I have decided to go with the suggested project which is a recipe app.

This is a recipe app was built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.
As a developer, I am currently in the process of learning this architecture, and this app was built as part of that learning process.

To speed up the development process, I decided to use a static backend (API) that I downloaded from Google.
This allowed me to focus on building the application and to futher learn architectures.

### Functionality

The Recipe App allows users to browse through a list of recipes per category and view the details of a selected recipe.
This App also includes the steps on how to cook the given recipe and view its ingredients.

Users can also add a recipe to their favorite list for future reference.

I have also used some animation like a hero widget for added user experience.

### Steps to Run

1. clone this repo
2. cd to the cloned repo
3. run flutter pub get
4. run the emulator
